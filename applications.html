Marketing:In the early 2000s, if we searched an online store to find a product without knowing it’s exact name, it would become a nightmare to find the product. But now when we search for an item on any e-commerce store, we get all possible results related to the item. It’s like these search engines read our minds! In a matter of seconds, we get a list of all relevant items. 
Banking:AI in banking is growing faster than you thought! A lot of banks have already adopted AI-based systems to provide customer support, detect anomalies and credit card frauds. An example of this is HDFC Bank.                                                        
HDFC Bank has developed an AI-based chatbot called EVA (Electronic Virtual Assistant), built by Bengaluru-based Senseforth AI Research.                                
Since its launch, Eva has addressed over 3 million customer queries, interacted with over half a million unique users, and held over a million conversations. Eva can collect knowledge from thousands of sources and provide simple answers in less than 0.4 seconds.
